# Installation

## General info

This project runs on:

- Angular (frontend)
- Google Forms / Google Sheets ("backend")
- GitHub Pages (hosting)

Since I don't have my own backend, everything is static JS and HTML, so
hosting is really simple. I use GitHub Pages, but anywhere works.

----

If you just want to use Bookworm, you have two options: A) use my hosted
version at prendradjaja.github.io/bookworm, or B) host it yourself.

In terms of usability, there is no difference. The difference is simply that
option A is easier to try out, but option B will probably be a little more
stable -- if I make backwards-incompatible changes, I won't break your stuff.
(If I add features you want in the future, you can bring your version up to
date.)

## Option A: Use my hosted version

1. Create a Google Form. You'll need exactly these questions (in this order,
   with exactly the same wording, case-sensitive):
    - What book?
        - Question type: Multiple choice
        - Write in the names of a couple books you're reading or are likely to
          read in the near future. Don't worry, you can change this later.
        - Make sure to enable "Other".
    - Start place (optional)
        - Question type: Short answer
        - **You must include this question** with the word "(optional)".
        - Actually, all of these questions are optional, but this is... more
          optional? Ha.
    - End place
        - Question type: Short answer
    - Notes
        - Question type: Paragraph
2. Share 

## Option B: Use your own hosted version
