## 2/17: DRY? What's that?

Forked my [Friendlog](https://github.com/prendradjaja/friendlog-web)
project and basically just search-and-replaced to turn it into a reading
tracker. It feels a little silly because there's so much duplicate code (and
parallel changes I'll be making in both), but I think while there is a lot in
common in these project now, they'll end up diverging and it doesn't really
make sense to abstract (make reusable) much of any of this stuff.
